# Priconf
> Work In Progres
Currently a HardCoded Firefox Browser Web Extension for having a unified
config for your favourite Privay Frontends.

## Motivation
The [Piped](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped) Instances I used from
[LibRedirect](https://github.com/libredirect/browser_extension) used to have
different settings for different instances.
So, I wanted all the instances that I use to have
same settings. So, here is the basic WebExtension I created over the Weekend.
Over Time I expanded this functionality to different Privay Frontends.

## Supported Frontends
- [Piped](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped)
- SearXNG
- LibReddit
- Nitter
- LibreMDB
- Quetre

## Project RoadMap
- [] Add UI
- [] Take Instances Input from User
- [] Allow User to Configure Settings via UI
- [] Publist this Plugin

## How To Use
If you want to use it you can HardCode your Settings in `priconf.js` and 
test this plugin in Firefox by visiting `about:debugging` and Installing this Plugin 
from there.

## What's Currently Working
All the Supported Frontends are Working Currently but settings needs to be HardCoded.
