# Priconf
> Work In Progres
Currently a HardCoded Firefox Browser Web Extension for having a unified
config for your favourite Privay Frontends.

## Motivation
The Piped Instances I used from LibRedirect used to have different settings 
for different instances. So, I wanted all the instances that I use to have 
same settings. Over Time I expanded this functionality to different Privay 
Frontends.

## Supported Frontends
- Piped
- SearXNG
- LibReddit
- Nitter
- LibreMDB
- Quetre

## Project RoadMap
[] Add UI
[] Take Instances Input from User
[] Allow User to Configure Settings via UI
[] Publist this Plugin

## How To Use
If you want to use it you can HardCode your Settings in `priconf.js` and 
test this plugin in Firefox by visiting `about:debugging` and Installing this Plugin 
from there.

## What's Currently Working
All the Supported Frontends are Working Currently but settings needs to be HardCoded.
